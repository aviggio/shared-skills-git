Learning to use Github for documentation, collaboration, revision and version control

This repository is designed to teach the use of github for collaboration, communication, and documentation.  This class is a combination of a classroom and an asynchronous exercise.

## Setup
1.  Install Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2.  If you are just getting started with Github install Github Desktop instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)
  * If you are comfortable with typing into a terminal and/or would like to maintain continuity with the DataCamp class you can use a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Terminal).  Instructions for getting setup with the "typing" version of Github are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart)
3.  If you have not already done so in the earlier steps sign up for a free Github account here [here](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).  
  * Once you have and account and are actively using Github we can add you to the ODA Organization on Github.  Our public projects are [here](https://github.com/cu-boulder)

## Explore
1. Explore to get a sense of what of what Github and how its used.  I found a few interesting repositiories:
  * https://github.com/shilohbradley: An IR Person from UNLV with profile includes some code for IPEDS analysis.
  * https://github.com/jasonpcasey: Some intersting higher-ed datasets, seems like an IR person.
  * https://github.com/unl-iea: University of Nebraska IR
  * https://github.com/MIT-IR: MIT IR, not much thats useful
  * https://github.com/nietsnel/institutional-research: An older repo explaining the value of R for an IR team
  * https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data COVID-19 Data
2. Somebody with the handle jbryer crearted a R library for downloading data from IPEDS.  The code is [here](https://github.com/jbryer/ipeds), if you look at the issues you'll see a few people have run into a problems and has asked for help.
3. I use my personal Github account to share code that I think might be useful to others.  The examples below show projects that have comments, issues, and have been used by other people.  I posted a project for visualing the output from a kind of neural network [here](https://github.com/geoss/som_visualization_r).  That public repository attracted some conversation [here](https://github.com/geoss/som_visualization_r/issues?q=).  At one point recently the code broke and some guy in the Netherlands fixed it.  by clicking on number next to the fork symbol I can see who has been using the code. 


## Do Stuff
# Workflow

1. Clone the github repo
2. Create a new branch called lastname_firstname (e.g. dylan_bob)
3. Edit the readme file by 1) answering the questions directly below your name and 2) removing your name from the Up Next List.
4. Commit and push the changes to personally named branch (e.g. dylan_bob)
5. Create a pull request so that Brad or others can review the code changes.  Brad will "merge" your pull request with the "master" branch.
7. Delete your branch
8. Contact the next person on the list by creating an issue
