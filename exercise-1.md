# Exercise 1

1.  In github desktop create a "clone" of this repository.  This creates a local copy (i.e. on you computer) of the files stored online in github.  To do this use the enter `cu-boulder/shared-skills-git` into github desktop as demonstrated in the video below.

2.  In visual studio code open the folder called `shared-skills-git.`  Navigate to the "your-docs" folder.  Create a new file called "*your-name*.md".  The "md" extenssion stands for markdown which is a simple way to write formatted documents.
3.  Practice writing some markdown:
  * Begin your document with the line `# your name`
  * On the next line write your hometown, place this in italics using the '*' symbol.  For me its, `\*New York, NY\*`
  * On the next line create a bulleted list of your three favorite foods.  How do you make a bulleted list in markdown?  See a quick tutorial [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
  * For an example see **sethspielman.md** in the folder.
4. Once you've completed the file, follow the add>commit>push workflow to add it to the online repository.  The exact steps to do this will vary depending on if you are using the terminal or github desktop.
  * In the terminal: `git add your-docs/*yourfilename.md*` then `git commit -m "adding my file"` then git push.
  * In the desktop app check the box next to the file you want to upload, on the left side panel of the app, type a commit messafe (lower left), and the push by clicking the button to push (top center).

PS - Markdown is really useful, simple editor.  I wrote [an entire book with some friends using Markdown](https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Analytics-Spatial-Gis/dp/1473958636).
